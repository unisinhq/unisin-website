## Product Vision

UNISIN exists to become the central communication layer for the creator economy.

As creators grow, their inboxes fragment across platforms. This fragmentation causes missed deals, slow responses, and unnecessary stress. UNISIN solves this by separating **signal from noise** — prioritizing professional conversations and monetizable opportunities.

### Long-Term Vision
UNISIN evolves from a unified inbox into a creator operations platform:
- Message management
- Deal tracking
- Brand relationship history
- Team collaboration
- Creator CRM

### Guiding Principles
1. **Signal first** — prioritize important messages
2. **API-compliant always** — no scraping, no shortcuts
3. **Creator-first UX** — fast, focused, minimal
4. **Scalable by design** — solo creators → agencies

### Success Metric
If a creator never misses a brand inquiry again, UNISIN has succeeded.

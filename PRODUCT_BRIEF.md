UNISIN — Product Brief
Tagline: The signal, not the noise.
Who It’s For
Unisin is built for mid-sized creators and influencers who receive inbound messages from brands, collaborators, and fans across multiple platforms and need a single system to manage those conversations efficiently.
The Problem
Creators miss opportunities because their messages are fragmented across email, Instagram, LinkedIn, Discord, X, YouTube, and Reddit. Important brand inquiries get buried, replies fall through the cracks, and managing conversations becomes chaotic and stressful.
The Solution
Unisin provides a unified inbox that aggregates messages from multiple platforms into one clean, organized interface. Creators can view, label, prioritize, and respond to high-value conversations without switching apps or losing context.

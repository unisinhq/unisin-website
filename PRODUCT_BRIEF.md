# UNISIN — Product Brief
**Tagline:** The signal, not the noise.

## Overview
Unisin is a unified messaging platform built for creators and influencers who receive inbound messages across multiple platforms and need a single system to manage high-value conversations without distraction or missed opportunities.

## Target User
Unisin is designed for mid-sized creators and influencers (approximately 10k–500k followers) who actively receive inbound messages from brands, collaborators, and communities across email and social platforms.

These users already monetize attention and are overwhelmed by fragmented inboxes rather than lacking reach.

## Problem
Inbound messages are scattered across platforms such as email, Instagram, LinkedIn, Discord, X (Twitter), YouTube, and Reddit. Important brand inquiries are easily missed, conversations lose context, and creators waste time switching between apps to manage replies.

Missed messages often result in missed revenue, damaged relationships, and unnecessary stress.

## Solution
Unisin consolidates inbound messages from supported platforms into a single, normalized inbox. Messages are organized into a consistent format that allows creators to quickly identify, prioritize, and respond to important conversations from one place.

Unisin focuses on reducing noise and highlighting signal — the messages that matter most.

## Core Capabilities
- Unified inbox for multiple messaging platforms
- Normalized message format across sources
- Message labeling (e.g. Brand, Collaboration, Fan)
- Read, unread, and archive states
- Direct replies from the Unisin interface where platform APIs allow
- Secure authentication and token management

## Supported Platforms (Planned)
- Email (Gmail initially)
- Instagram Business
- LinkedIn Pages
- Discord
- X (Twitter)
- YouTube
- Reddit

## Non-Goals
Unisin is intentionally not:
- A social media posting or scheduling tool
- A content management or calendar platform
- An outbound sales or CRM system
- An AI auto-reply or chatbot tool (initially)
- A replacement for native social media apps
- Designed for users without an established audience

## Product Philosophy
Unisin prioritizes clarity, focus, and reliability over feature breadth. The product is built around the belief that creators need fewer tools, not more — and that the most valuable conversations should never be lost in the noise.
